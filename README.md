## Hey! I'm Adib Rohani

I study _Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science (AI)_.

My course has given me strong foundations in **full-stack web development, data structures and algorithms, networks and operating systems, classical AI, knowledge representation, and optimisation algorithms**. 

I'm passionate about making information, knowledge and insight more accessible for people, communities, and institutions. Not sure what that means yet entirely â€“ give me a few years to figure that out.

### Projects 
I have been fortunate enough to work with...
- [Intelife](https://intelife.org/), a disability service provider, to make text documents more accessible for people with learning disabilities, and
- [Arterial AI](https://arterial.ai/), a health services startup, to create data/software architecture for analytic dashboards
